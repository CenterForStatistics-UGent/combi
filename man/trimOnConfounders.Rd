\title{Trim based on confounders to avoid taxa with only zero counts}
\usage{
trimOnConfounders(confounders, data, prevCutOff, minFraction, n)
}
\arguments{
\item{confounders}{a nxt confounder matrix}

\item{data}{the data matrix}

\item{prevCutOff}{a scalar between 0 and 1, the prevalence cut off}

\item{minFraction}{a scalar between 0 and 1,
each taxon's total abundance should equal at least the number of samples n
 times minFraction, otherwise it is trimmed}

\item{n}{the number of samples

Should be called prior to fitting the independence model}
}
\value{
A trimmed data matrix nxp'
